### Salsa Taquera

This is an example recipe off the internet.

- 2 roma tomatoes
- 2 garlic cloves
- tiny sliver of onion
- 12oz canned chipotles en adobo
- apple cider vinegar
- 7-10 chile de arbol dried or 15 to 20 pequin dried
- salt to taste

Roast the tomatoes,onion and garlic in a pan with a lid, add a splash of water. After about 10 minutes add the dried chiles and toss them around for about 2 more minutes. Dont let them burn or they'll be bitter. In a blender add 2 or 3 of the canned chipotles along with a teaspoon of vinegar and the rest of the roasted ingredients. Add any of the leftover cooking water as well. Blend until smooth and add salt to taste. Remember the canned chipotles already have some salt so make sure to taste it before adding salt.

If too spicy roast and add another tomato. If too thick add some of the chipotle blend from the can. The general idea is to get a roasted flavor with some sweetness from the chipotle.
