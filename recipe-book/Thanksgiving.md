Thanksgiving

# Turkey 
## Brine
- 10 teaspoons liquid smoke
- dried thyme/dried rosemary/fresh rosemary 2 cups water boiled for 10 minutes
- 2 cups salt
- 7 quarts of water

Thaw out turkey 24 hours for every 5 pounds. Clean turkey and remove guts place in brine overnight. Before roasting pat dry and generously coat with vegetable oil then stuff with whatever aromatics you want. Roast for about 13 minutes for every pound. Check your turkey after 3 hours and every 1/2 hour after by placing meat thermometer in thigh. Make sure its not touching bone. It should read at least 165F - to be super safe 170-175. If it gets too dark you can cover it with foil. After the turkey is done you can tent it with foil and let it rest and it should raise the temp up a bit too.
